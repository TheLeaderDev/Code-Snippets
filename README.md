<h1 align="center">⚡️ Welcome to Code Snippets ⚡️</h1>
<h6 align="center">Here I share many code snippets, most of which are in PHP.</h6>
<br>
<br>

> **P.S:** From now on, every code snippet I add will be recorded here.
The goal is to create a practical archive — so I can easily find them myself, and you can use them or get inspired. 🌱💻
